"""What happens when you run the following code? Why?

NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

The code greets Victor three times and then it greets Nina three
times, because Python doesn't enforce constant not being able to 
be reassigned.
